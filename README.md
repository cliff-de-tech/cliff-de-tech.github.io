## About This Project

This portfolio is a static site built from the ground up using core web technologies. It serves as a central hub for my projects, skills, and professional experience. The main goal was to create a clean, modern, and performant user experience that reflects my design philosophy.

## Features

* **Fully Responsive:** The layout seamlessly adapts to all device sizes, from mobile phones to desktop monitors.
* **Dark/Light Mode:** A theme-toggle feature allows users to switch between dark and light modes, with their preference saved in local storage.
* **Animated Background:** A subtle, GPU-friendly animated particle background (built with HTML Canvas) provides a dynamic feel without compromising performance.
* **Project Filtering:** The portfolio page features tabs to filter projects by category (Graphic Design, UI/UX, Web Design).
* **CSS Optimizations:** The site is optimized for speed, including deferred CSS loading and prioritized loading for critical content.
* **CSS Animations:** Subtle "reveal-on-scroll" animations and hover effects are used to enhance the user experience.

## Technologies Used

This project was built without any external CSS or JS frameworks.

* **HTML5:** For semantic structure.
* **CSS3:** For all styling, including responsive design (media queries), layouts (Flexbox/Grid), and animations.
* **JavaScript (ES6+):** For all interactivity, including:
    * Theme toggle
    * Mobile navigation menu

    * "Read More" toggles on the About page
